# week 1 review of biochar

three main direction to dive in
|real-world application (with market)|types & functionality of pyrolysis plants|carbon credit in the UK Emission Trading Scheme (ETS)|
|---|---|---|
|as catalyst, for catalysis of direct reactions. provide low cost, and effective properties for chemical reactions. reduced efficiency| | |
|energy storage, ultilisation of electrode materials, fairly economical, extreme porous, with wide suface area. Poor performance| | |
|soil amendment, increase soil fertility and quality, as well as carbon sequestration, low cost, reduce GHG emissions, aides in retain nutrient and water. contamination persists| | |
|absorbent removing organic & inorganic contaminants, minimal cost, effective in improving sorption of contaminants. limited effectiveness on pollutant degradtion, contamination remains| | |
|composting, enhance microbial population, carbon mineralisation. produces GHG, retains nutrients, large surface area. Contamination risk in area| | |
