# week 1 review of biochar

three main direction to dive in, real world application, types and functionality of pyrolysis plants, and the carbon credit in the UK Emission trading Scheme

Current application of biochar in general

|real-world application (with market)|Example|
|---|---|
|as catalyst, for catalysis of direct reactions. reduced efficiency||
|energy storage, ultilisation of electrode materials. Poor performance|Shropshire Council & Woodtek Engineering|
|soil amendment, increase soil fertility and quality, as well as carbon sequestration, low cost, reduce GHG emissions, aides in retain nutrient and water. contamination persists|Shropshire Council & Woodtek Engineering, Aston University EBRI Urban Biochar Demonstrator|
|absorbent removing organic & inorganic contaminants, minimal cost, effective in improving sorption of contaminants. limited effectiveness on pollutant degradtion, contamination remains||
|composting, enhance microbial population, carbon mineralisation. produces GHG, retains nutrients, large surface area. Contamination risk in area|Mersey Biochar Lingley Mere|

what are the types of pyrolysis and what functionality does each reactor design propose

types & functionality of pyrolysis plants

|slow pyrolysis (fixed rotary kil)n|fast pyrolysis (fluidised bed)|intermediate pyrolysis|gasification (partial oxidation)|hydrothermal carbonisation(HTC)|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|produces biochar for soil amendment & landscape use|primarily for bio-oil, not relevant to park waste biochar.|demonstrations of bio-oil + biochar co-use|energy generation|treats wet feedstocks (sludge/food waste) at ~200 °C under pressure; produces hydrochar, not true biochar — unsuitable for park woody waste.|
|used by Woodtek Engineering / Shropshire Council (Welshpool)|not park sector related, for industrial bio-oil plants|used by EBRI Pyrotest unit for research|power plants and Energy for Waste|water utilities|not park sector related|


carbon credit in the UK ETS
currently not in the UK ETS. Biochar credits are not yet eligible under the UK ETS compliance system. At present, they are issued and sold only through voluntary carbon markets such as Puro.earth, the European Biochar Certificate (EBC), and UN Offset Platform registries.
- regulatory Design
  - the UK ETS is a cap-and-trade system allowing only official UK Allowances (UKAs). offsets (including biochar) are excluded until new Greenhouse Gas Removal (GGR) rules are legislated.
- verification & Integrity Requirements
  - the government’s GGR Analytical Annex (2025) states that removals must prove:
    - permanence ≥ 200 years of carbon storage.
    - monitoring, reporting & verification (MRV) compliance.
    - liability for reversals (who is responsible if carbon is re-emitted).
- technical and legislative timeline
  - 2025 – consultations and MRV framework development.
  - by 2028 – legislation to enable engineered GGRs (biochar, DAC, BECCS).
  - by 2029 – integration into the UK ETS once verification and storage standards are finalised.
