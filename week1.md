# week 1 review of biochar

three main direction to dive in, real world application, types and functionality of pyrolysis plants, and the carbon credit in the UK Emission trading Scheme

Current application of biochar in general

|real-world application (with market)|Example|
|---|---|
|as catalyst, for catalysis of direct reactions. provide low cost, and effective properties for chemical reactions. reduced efficiency||
|energy storage, ultilisation of electrode materials, fairly economical, extreme porous, with wide suface area. Poor performance|Shropshire Council & Woodtek Engineering|
|soil amendment, increase soil fertility and quality, as well as carbon sequestration, low cost, reduce GHG emissions, aides in retain nutrient and water. contamination persists|Aston University EBRI Urban Biochar Demonstrator|
|absorbent removing organic & inorganic contaminants, minimal cost, effective in improving sorption of contaminants. limited effectiveness on pollutant degradtion, contamination remains||
|composting, enhance microbial population, carbon mineralisation. produces GHG, retains nutrients, large surface area. Contamination risk in area|Mersey Biochar Lingley Mere|

what are the types of pyrolysis and what functionality does each reactor design propose

types & functionality of pyrolysis plants

|slow pyrolysis (fixed rotary kil)n|fast pyrolysis (fluidised bed)|intermediate pyrolysis|gasification (partial oxidation)|hydrothermal carbonisation(HTC)|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|produces biochar for soil amendment & landscape use|n/a|demonstrations of bio-oil + biochar co-use|energy generation|n/a|
|used by Woodtek Engineering / Shropshire Council (Welshpool)|not park sector related, for industrial bio-oil plants|used by EBRI Pyrotest unit for research|power plants and Energy for Waste|water utilities|not park sector related|
